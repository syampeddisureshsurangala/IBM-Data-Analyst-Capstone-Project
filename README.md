# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

In this project, we will assume that we have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. 

## Project Overview
To keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, our organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. As a Data Analyst, we will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills.

## Objectives
- Collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:
  - Job postings
  - Training portals
  - Surveys
- Analyze the collected data to identify insights and trends.

## Data Collection
Our first task is to collect the top programming skills that are in demand. We will gather data from:
- Job postings
- Training portals
- Surveys

## Data Analysis
Once we have collected enough data, we will begin analyzing the data to identify insights and trends. The analysis process will include:
1. Data cleaning and preparation
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Identifying key trends and patterns

## Project Structure
Each step of the data analysis process is documented in different notebooks within this repository, along with additional files needed for understanding the analysis.
